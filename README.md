# VisitBosnia
VisitBosnia is a new project that will make travel easier for tourists and locals. The aim of the project is to bring all tourists attractions, restaurants, fast foods, hotels and other businesses together in one place so that people can easily travel around the city or visitors can schedule their trip ahead of time. Every place added to the website will contain detailed description and details such as its location, price (if applicable), web site, phone number, and so on. Businesses will be grouped based on the city.

# Three CS/IS Sophomores collaborated on this project:
-	Adna Salković
-	Azra Kurtić
-	Faris Begić
